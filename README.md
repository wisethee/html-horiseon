### Acceptance Criteria
The project must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible ``alt`` attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

### Resources
- [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
- [Image Alt Attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp)


### Steps to follow
1. Download your [starter code](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/uk-16/activities/01-html-git-github-module/04-code-refactor-lesson/challenge.zip) to an external site. for this Challenge and unzip the zip file.
2. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.
3. Add the starter code to the new repo on your computer and work through the Challenge.
4. When you're ready to deploy, use the ``git add``, ``git commit``, and ``git push`` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.
5. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.
6. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the ``main`` branch as your source.
7. Navigate to ``<your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name>`` and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be ``<lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>``.
